      <h3>Cultural Influences of Food</h3>
      <p>The kingdom of Astonia is a vast empire that rules over many countries spanning different landmasses.  
        After their conquest of Lidenfell, the country that Everwinter once belonged to, the land was integrated into the empire as 
        a colony of the Astonian empire.</p>
      <p>Due to the advantageous location of the neighboring town of Airedale, its 
        proximity to fertile farming lands, large bodies of water, and central location between other countries and empires, 
        made it a prime candidate to become a reknown port city and epicenter of trade among merchants.  The royal family of Astonia thus  
        designated Airedale as the trading capital of the land.</p>
      <p>In the years following this royal degree, the economic status and prosperity of the city experienced a growth that had never 
        seen before.  The amount of trade nearly quadrupled within this span of time, and with this increase in trade, brought along 
        with it, an influx in settlers.  These people came from all walks of life, from merchants whose businesses depended on being in a 
        central location, to the fisherman who relied on the markets for their daily catches, to the craftsman who could finally find a place
        to sell their detailed handiwork.  Among these also included nobles from aristocratic families who were seeking some sort of adventure 
        as well.  And as such, because of its location between three different countries, Whitebridge, Athelney, and Mikana, settlers from different
        cultures and ethnicities eventually settled down here, bringing with it influences and cuisines from all around the world.  
      </p>
      <p>These rich cultural influences bled into the neighboring town of Everwinter, where Sunrise Villa is located, and have shaped the cuisine 
        as to what it is today, which is a melting pot and fusion of different delicacies.  From Whitebridge, a country ruled by the Danes monarchy, 
        there was a heavy influence on the consumption of a balanced and clean diet, consisting of freshly carved meat of pork, beef, chicken, or duck, 
        alongside the heartiness of the vegetables of the earth, such as carrots, potatoes, and leafy greens, like spinach and broccoli.  
      </p>
      <p>As for the cultural influence from Athelney, their cuisine was largely based around carbohydrates, and similar to that of Italian cuisine today.  
        As such, their pasta dishes are cooked with a type of cream-based, tomato-based, or other plant-herb based sauce, along with some type of poultry, 
        meat, or seafood.  Another specialty of theirs is pizza, which is a savory dish consisting of a dough, layered with a sauce, usually tomato, and topped with 
        cheese, and typically vegetables.  Over time, people have experimented with this recipe, and have innovated different cultural fusions with creative toppings.
      </p>

      <p>From the country of Mikana, Eastern influences have become interlaced among the more Western influences from Whitebrige and Athelney.
        The eastern cuisine from Mikana relies on the usage of spices and ingredients less commonly found in the west, and are usually required to be exported.  
        Their cuisine is largely based around grain, mainly rice, along with the use of ingredients such as soy, tofu, ginger, garlic, onions, and sesame seeds.
      </p>

      <p>The cuisine that you will experience here in Everwinter is based in a rich history comprosing of the mixture of three different yet rich cultures from 
        Whitebridge, Athelney, and Mikana.  The amalgamation of these influences are unique to this land, and a different experience from those found elsewhere.

      <h2 class="margin">A Look Through Our History</h2><br>

      <a class="d-flex"></a>
      <p>When Sunrise Inn was first founded, it was a simple cottage of fifteen rooms used by the frequent travelers making their journey to Airedale.  
        The establishment was founded by Ava Hughes and William Hughes, a couple who had fled the war-torn empire of Axistosia, a country to the west of Astonia.  
        Thirty years ago, Axistosia was caught in a power struggle between two families that vied for the throne of Axistosia.  During this period, many farms and
        families were destroyed in fires and looting as armies stormed villages as they made their way towards battle.  
      </p> <br>
      
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-6">
          <p> Ava Hughes was sixteen years old when the Rosenbaum family staged a coup against the Alexei family, who occupied the throne at that time.  She worked 
            in a bakery in a small village named Frostfell just outside the capital at that time.  During that time, William Hughes was twenty years old and a belonged to a well-to-do 
            family that occupied the upper echelons of the ranks in the palace at that time.  He was a captain consigned to the 67th Battleground Unit, and was rising the 
            ranks quickly due to his tactical brilliance in warfare. </p> <br> 
          
          <p>During the Battle of Frostfell, William was injured and left to die in the woods and near a river.  He lay there, coming to peace that this would be his 
            last day, and closed his eyes, as he passed out from blood loss.  Ava was out to gather fresh water near a river that day, and found William lying there, unresponsive.
            Ava was always a kind and compassionate young woman, and she brought him home to nurse him back to health.  As the circumstances worsened in the kingdom due to political unrest, 
            Ava's family was killed during a raid one day, and she and William fled the country across to Astonia.  They lived in poverty and in desperation for many years, trying to find a way 
            to make a meager living.  She became a waitress at pubs and William became an apprentice to a merchant.</p>

          <p>When Airedale became a port city, William followed his master to there, and they settled down.  He began making an establishment in the trade of textiles and spices, 
            just as they were starting to boom, and he began making enough money to become moderately successful.  However, his job as a merchant had him traveling abroad for long 
            spans of time frequently, and he was afraid that he would pass the rest of his life without being able to spend time with Ava.  Thus, when he had finally saved enough, he 
            discussed with his wife what to do next, and they decided that they would open an inn in the quainter city of Everwinter nearby.  That inn would become what is known as 
            Sunrise Villa today, and thrives under the warm hospitality of Ava and William, who welcomes all who seek a home in this turbulent world.
          </p> <br>
          
          <p>The location of Sunrise Inn in a town immersed in nature provides many benefits for both physical and mental well-being.  
            It allows people to disconnect from the stresses of life and lends an aspect of spirituality, which include finding personal growth and meaning within 
            an individual.

        <div class="col-sm-6">
          <div id="scroll-box-2">
            <p>Some side facts and details: </p>
            <p>As for the kingdom of Axistosia, the coup that was staged by the Rosenbaum family against the Alexei family was successful.  The transition of power was a 
              messy and rough one, that took over a year to completely stabilize.  During this time, there were many battles, and the summation of these battles became a civil
              war.  Some of these battles took place in villages, such as farming villages, and trading towns, and there was a lot a devastation.</p>
            <p>Many villages were destroyed, many crops were burned, and many lives were lost.  Lives were lost on both sides of the army.  Yet, the greatest tragedy of all 
              was that there were many civilian lives that were lost.  The greatest casualties of war were the men, women, children, and elderly who had nothing 
              to die with the war itself, yet were caught up in the struggle for power.  
            </p>
            <p>One of these casualties was the village of Frostfell where Ava was from, and where she found William when he was injured.  The village 
              was set fire to in one of the battles, as the Rosenbaum family fought to gain a base close to the kingdom.  Ava's family was unfortunately caught up 
              in this embroilment, and her mother and father was killed as the village was pillaged.  William was able to protect and hide with her, and they, 
              by the greatest of miracles, were able to flee with nothing but their lives.  
            </p>
            <p>The trek to the Astonia took nearly a week, and they only survived by hunting and scouring the forests, and selling the pelts of animals that William 
              was able to hunt in the forest.  They did not earn much from this, but they did make enough to be able to afford staying at inns along the way.  
            </p>

            <p>They initially settled at a small city, but lived, only making enough to scrape by during that time.  Ava began taking up jobs as a waitress in pubs, 
              and Willima encountered a merchant who took an interest to him, and was willing to make him his apprentice.
